# üöÄ RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT STATUS - TIMESTAMP FIX

**Date:** October 9, 2025 - 16:20 UTC+8  
**Issue:** Railway hasn't deployed the timestamp fix yet  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FORCE DEPLOYMENT TRIGGERED**

---

## üî• **CURRENT SITUATION**

### **The Problem:**

Railway has NOT deployed the timestamp fix (commit `a6057ae`) yet. The backend is still using the old code with ISO format timestamps, causing:

```
POST /api/comments 400 (Bad Request)
Failed to create comment: Incorrect datetime value: '2025-10-09T16:15:46.015Z' 
for column 'created_at' at row 1
```

### **Evidence:**

The error message shows the backend is receiving:
```
'2025-10-09T16:15:46.015Z'  ‚ùå (ISO format - OLD CODE)
```

But it should be receiving:
```
'2025-10-09 16:15:46'  ‚úÖ (MySQL DATETIME format - NEW CODE)
```

This proves Railway is still running the old code.

## ‚úÖ **ACTIONS TAKEN**

### **1. Verified Code is Pushed to GitHub:**

```bash
git log --oneline -5

4455503 (HEAD -> main, origin/main) FORCE RAILWAY DEPLOY: Trigger deployment...
